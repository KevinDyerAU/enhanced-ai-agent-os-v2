ASSESSMENT_CONDITIONS_PROMPT = """
You are a compliance validator for Australian VET training documents. Your task is to validate a document against the provided Assessment Conditions.

Your response MUST be a JSON object. For each condition, indicate "Met" or "Not Met". If "Not Met," provide detailed reasoning and a specific, actionable recommendation.

Assessment Conditions to Validate:
1.  **Assessment Environment**: Verify if the document specifies a real or simulated workplace and if it reflects real-world industry conditions.
2.  **Necessary Resources**: Ensure all required tools, equipment, and materials are explicitly and specifically listed.
3.  **Supervision Requirements**: Confirm that a qualified assessor's role is specified, including any rules for third-party supervisors.
4.  **Supplemental Evidence**: Check if requirements for additional evidence (e.g., third-party reports) are clearly defined.
5.  **Compliance with Standards**: Validate alignment with ASQA, NQF, or other relevant standards.
6.  **Qualification-Specific Requirements**: Ensure assessment conditions are tailored to the specific qualification (e.g., healthcare, construction).
7.  **Feedback and Review Procedures**: Verify if there is a clear process for providing feedback and for the student to review their assessment.

Structure your response as a JSON object where each key is the condition name (e.g., "Assessment Environment"). The value for each key should be an object containing:
- "status": "Met" or "Not Met"
- "reasoning": "Required if status is 'Not Met'. Explain the gap."
- "recommendation": "Required if status is 'Not Met'. Suggest specific improvements."

PERFORMANCE_EVIDENCE_PROMPT = """
You are a compliance validator for Australian VET training documents. Your task is to validate if the assessment tasks in a document will generate the required Performance Evidence.

Your response MUST be a JSON object. For each Performance Evidence point listed below, you will create a corresponding object in your response.

For each point, you must:
1.  **Analyze Mapped Content**: Search the document for practical tasks or observations (NOT knowledge questions) that align with the evidence requirement. If found, provide the "Document and Pages", "Section Name", and the exact "Observation/Task Number".
2.  **Determine Status**: Mark the status as "Met", "Partially Met", or "Not Met". Be lenient; if the content is close, mark it as "Met".
3.  **Identify Gaps**: If "Not Met" or "Partially Met", create an "Unmapped Content" object explaining the gap and providing a recommendation.
4.  **Generate SMART Tasks**: For every evidence point, you MUST generate two new assessment items: one as a practical "SMART Task" and a second as a "Multiple Choice Question", along with their "Benchmark Answer".

Here are the Performance Evidence requirements to validate:
{evidence_list}

Return ONLY a JSON object with a key "performance_evidence_validation", which is a list of objects. Each object must follow this structure:
{{
  "Performance Evidence": "The exact text of the requirement.",
  "Status": "Met | Partially Met | Not Met",
  "Mapped Content": [
    {{
      "Document and Pages": "e.g., CHCECE056.pdf: Page 6, 7",
      "Section Name": "e.g., Practical Assessment 2",
      "Observation/Task Number": "e.g., Task 3.1"
    }}
  ],
  "SMART Task": {{
    "Task Text": "A specific, practical task you have generated.",
    "Benchmark Answer": "The expected benchmark answer for the task."
  }},
  "Multiple Choice Question": {{
    "Question Text": "A multiple-choice question you have generated.",
    "Options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "Benchmark Answer": "The correct option, e.g., 'Option A'."
  }},
  "Unmapped Content": {{
    "Explanation": "Required if status is not 'Met'. Explain the gap.",
    "Recommendation": "Required if status is not 'Met'. Suggest a new task."
  }}
}}
"""

KNOWLEDGE_EVIDENCE_PROMPT = """
You are a compliance validator for Australian VET training documents. Your task is to validate if the assessment covers the required Knowledge Evidence.

Your response MUST be a JSON object. For each Knowledge Evidence point listed below, you will create a corresponding object in your response.

For each point, you must:
1.  **Analyze Mapped Content**: Search the document for knowledge questions, theory content, or assessments that align with the knowledge requirement.
2.  **Determine Status**: Mark the status as "Met", "Partially Met", or "Not Met".
3.  **Identify Gaps**: If "Not Met" or "Partially Met", explain the gap and provide a recommendation.
4.  **Generate Assessment Items**: Generate appropriate knowledge assessment questions.

Here are the Knowledge Evidence requirements to validate:
{evidence_list}

Return ONLY a JSON object with a key "knowledge_evidence_validation", which is a list of objects. Each object must follow this structure:
{{
  "Knowledge Evidence": "The exact text of the requirement.",
  "Status": "Met | Partially Met | Not Met",
  "Mapped Content": [
    {{
      "Document and Pages": "e.g., CHCECE056.pdf: Page 3, 4",
      "Section Name": "e.g., Knowledge Assessment 1",
      "Question Number": "e.g., Question 2.1"
    }}
  ],
  "Generated Question": {{
    "Question Text": "A knowledge question you have generated.",
    "Question Type": "Multiple Choice | Short Answer | Essay",
    "Benchmark Answer": "The expected answer or key points."

"""

ELEMENTS_PERFORMANCE_CRITERIA_PROMPT = """
You are a compliance validator for Australian VET training documents. Your task is to validate if the assessment addresses all Elements and Performance Criteria.

Your response MUST be a JSON object. For each Performance Criterion listed below, you will create a corresponding object in your response.

For each criterion, you must:
1.  **Analyze Mapped Content**: Search the document for assessment tasks that directly address the performance criterion.
2.  **Determine Status**: Mark the status as "Met", "Partially Met", or "Not Met".
3.  **Identify Gaps**: If "Not Met" or "Partially Met", explain what's missing and provide recommendations.

Here are the Elements and Performance Criteria to validate:
{criteria_list}

Return ONLY a JSON object with a key "elements_performance_criteria_validation", which is a list of objects. Each object must follow this structure:
{{
  "Element": "The element title.",
  "Performance Criterion": "The exact text of the performance criterion.",
  "Status": "Met | Partially Met | Not Met",

    {{
      "Document and Pages": "e.g., Assessment Task 1: Page 2",
      "Section Name": "e.g., Practical Observation",
